# Resume-parsing
This is the AI project I did in collaboration with my fellow co-woker at the start-up company. We recruited data annotators who annotated several resumes. After that, we utilized them, preprocessed and trained the model using spacy. Our outcomes are that when a resume is inputted, output such as name, email, job description,ect is returned.
